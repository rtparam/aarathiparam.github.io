My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I also took courses on political philosophy, wildlife studies and our core courses on understanding India which covered the history and evolution of demography of India through the lenses of caste, class, gender and religion. I truly cherished my time at the liberal studies program at APU because of the opportunity I had to study fields outside of my major, which have changed my perspective about the society we live in. My interdisciplinary studies form a big part of what I aspire to do in my research career, using the skills I have honed as a physicist and to do work that has a social impact.\nOutside of academics, I enjoy playing football, running and spend a significant amount of my day reading or playing guitar. I am also a trained musician, as a vocalist and instrumentalist; I play five instruments and I grew up learning Indian and Western Classical music.

    "title": "How Skateboarding Keeps Kids in School in Kerala",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a feature story I wrote for my undergraduate journalism course called Writing for the Media. It is a piece about a skateboarding group in my hometown and an NGO-run school in my state that helps get children off the streets with skateboarding as an incentive. I wrote this in 2021, after interviweing all the people mentioned in the piece, and since then the group have successfully built the first skate park in the city.\n\nOutside the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi, a five-year-old skateboarder, Janaki Anand - clad in a little purple polka dot frock, safety pads, and a helmet almost double the size of her head - successfully landed a skateboarding stair shredding trick after numerous attempts, and brought her to tears of joy. Her video went viral and moved many on Instagram, generating about 3.3 million views. This scene is just a glimpse into the fiery passion for skateboarding in Kerala, where the sport has not only been getting people on skateboards and onto the streets but is also getting kids off the streets and into schools.\nThe sport found its origins in the 1940s, starting as ‘sidewalk surfing’ and since then it has grown to be one of the most popular sports in the world. The upcoming Tokyo Olympics is also set to witness the sports official entry into the Olympics. Skateboarding is still relatively new in India, with the first skate park having opened only in 2003 in Goa. Nevertheless, the last decade has seen a significant surge in skateboarders from India, who have also gained worldwide recognition.\nLike the rest of the country, Kerala was also quick to catch up on the skateboarding scene. FlySquad is Kochi’s first and only registered skateboarding club. It was started by a group of seven people who began skateboarding after seeing it in action for the first time in the sports store, Decathlon. It was officially registered in December 2015, but its popularity grew after the success of its Instagram handle, created in 2017. Joel Abhishek, one of the founding members of FlySquad says “Our mission is to create a skateboarding community in the city, where we can share skateboarding knowledge and help people get into the sport, training them with the basics for no fee. That’s why we have no joining fee - we’re open to all”. Members of the club meet every evening between 7 PM and 12 AM outside the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium to practice together, learn new tricks and conduct other activities like street dancing, hip-hop, and rapping. The group also organises events and workshops in schools and cafes. Every year on June 21st, which is the international day of skateboarding, boarders from across the city meet to celebrate together. In 2020, given the pandemic, conducting an event of this sort was off-limits. Instead, they skateboarded all over the city and delivered food packets to the homeless.\nSkating on roads often gets these boarders into trouble with the police. On the 27th of October 2020, a couple of boarders were stopped by the police, who seized their skateboards for no apparent reason, even though they followed all COVID protocol. The scene drew a crowd and a video about the incident that was circulated on social media went viral which gave FlySquad gained immense support from the public.\nSreekumar Santhosh, popularly known as Sreekuttan says, “the biggest problem is that Kochi does not have a skate park. If there was a skate park, we wouldn’t have to get on the streets and get into trouble with the cops. People from other districts like Kasaragod and Thrissur come here to skate, so given the number of skaters, we definitely need a park. We also need one if we want to compete professionally - flat ground and roads are not enough for practice, we need to get used to ramps”. A few boarders from FlySquad attended a national competition called Jugaad in December 2019. They participated but could not win because they did not have enough practice within a skate park. “We need to regularly practice with ramps if we want to compete. There are only two skate parks in Kerala- in Calicut and Kovalam, and going there means travelling for 400 kilometres, which is not easy”, says Sreekuttan. Land for the skate park in Kochi has been made available, a company has agreed to do the construction free of cost and Decathlon has also guaranteed support. The only problem they face now is the lack of funds for the material since government authorities are not willing to sponsor the park. Sreekuttan mentions, “ Professionally, I’m a graphic designer but skateboarding is my passion. The plan is that in a few years when the skate park is ready, we’re going to turn FlySquad into a brand and set up a skate shop to make and sell boards, spare parts, t-shirts, and other merchandise”.\nFurther south in the state, in the beach town of Kovalam, skateboarding is more than just a sport. It is a second chance at education for some kids, owing to an NGO called Sebastian Indian Social Projects (SISP) launched by a social work graduate from Belgium, Paul Van Gelder in 1996. They aim to help students who have dropped out of school to complete their education, using skateboarding as an incentive. The school has two main policies: ‘no school, no skateboarding’ and ‘girls first’. Initially, a surf club was created and surfing was used as the incentive, but this led to a lot of problems - some kids were scared of the sea or allergic to the polluted seawater, and girls weren’t allowed to surf as the fishermen community in the area believed that girls shouldn’t go near the beach, especially in their adolescent years. Moreover, they could only surf from October to May, given the conditions of the sea. Thus surfing as an incentive to attend school did not succeed, although the surf club is renowned and is a source of employment for many people in the region. Yet, skateboarding served as an ideal replacement. A former student at the SISP school and the current coach, Vineeth Vijayan was given a skateboard from a friend, taught himself through YouTube, and realised that this would be more appealing than surfing, apart from being more convenient. A skate park and a mini ramp were built in the school in 2013, and around thirty students attended initially. Only if students attended school through the week were they allowed to skate on the weekends. This is easy to keep track of since the two skate parks are within the school compound and on the terrace. The SISP school provides basic education, following the regulations as prescribed by the government, also extending special provisions for students over the usual age group and free meals and insurance to the children as well as their families. Educational care beyond the school level is also provided, with students earning bachelor’s degrees as well. “Some of these kids were having a tough time before on the streets, dealing with problems of smoking, alcohol and drugs. Skateboarding has been a turning point in many of their (students) lives, including mine. It completely changed their lifestyle”, says coach Vineeth. The families of these students are skeptical about skateboarding, claiming that it’s of no use as it won’t bring in a steady income. “Once they pass their tenth grade exams, families are reluctant to continue sending them as they believe the tenth certificate is enough to get them a job”, says Vineeth. “After students won national level competitions and received certificates, it got a lot better as they realised that it was about talent, which they have, and not just money”. At the national competition held in Vizag in 2019, their students won four gold and two silver medals. Vidya Das, a seventh grade student and national level winner says, “I’ve gotten opportunities I would not have otherwise. I got to travel across the country, act in advertisements and movies”. She travelled to Rajasthan last year to shoot for an upcoming Netflix movie on skateboarding called Skater Girl. Joshan J, a tenth grade student at SISP mentions, “I heard about this place through my friend. If it wasn’t for skateboarding, I wouldn’t go to school”. One of the gold medallists at Vizag, he aspires to become a professional skateboarder. Students winning at these levels give parents some confidence, but it isn’t always affirmative. The school faces the problem of getting the parents to trust them. The issue of reluctance from parents is further exacerbated in the case of girls. “The fishermen community in the area is very traditional. By the time girls turn sixteen, they are not allowed to take part in sports as they believe this is when they have to learn how to become good wives and mothers”, says founder Paul Van Gelder. To combat this issue, in addition to the ‘girls first’ rule they have a female coach and girls-only sessions, to make the parents feel more comfortable. In spite of this, only 25% percent of the skaters are girls. This gender gap is also evident within FlySquad, which has less than ten female skaters. Sixteen-year-old Hadhiya Jannath, who goes by Kazi, is FlySquad’s youngest member. She says, “My parents are very supportive, but they are always taunted by other people in my society, especially when they see my older male skateboarder friends dropping me home late at night. They think I’m going down the wrong road. Only if this attitude changes will more girls be encouraged to join”.\nFinancial uncertainties are also a lingering problem for SISP. “Like most NGOs, we also have problems with getting sponsors and funding for materials. Skateboards and equipment are expensive and the kids need at least 3-4 pairs of shoes every year, as they wear out and get torn easily”, says Paul. Commenting on the effect of the pandemic he says, “The pandemic has been a problem as we had to stop our activities when the triple lockdown was enforced. We have two skateparks and only five children were allowed to use them at a time. Parents also did not allow their kids to come to school out of fear of the virus”. Vineeth mentions, “At the start of the pandemic, I went to their houses to give them masks, food and phones for them to attend classes online. If they had to recharge their internet, they called me and I did it for them. But it was difficult to get them to study”. The effect the pandemic had in getting the students to study brings up the question of how feasible incentive-based education of this sort is. Ramchandar Krishnamurthy, a professor of education at Azim Premji University whose research explores the philosophical and socio-political perspectives on education, though skeptical about the use of incentives, agrees that these can be very useful in getting students to attend schools. He says, “If these extrinsic incentives for motivation are seen as a scaffolding, where students experience education and develop a taste for it, it is just a pragmatic choice and I see no problem with it”.\nSkateboarding has been integrated into Kerala’s sport culture, be it an incentive to education or just a hobby, and the passion people have for it is remarkable. Sreekuttan says, “People always ask us why we carry these wooden planks every day, what use does it have? We need to make them realize that the happiness we get out of it isn’t just to put on a show, it’s what gives us freedom”."

    "title": "Striving Towards Gender Inclusivity in STEM in India",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is an op-ed piece I wrote for my undergraduate journalism course called Writing for the Media in 2021, on gender inclusivity in STEM in India.\nIt is no revelation that Andrea Ghez, the winner of the 2020 Nobel prize in Physics, is only the fourth woman to achieve the feat in the 120-odd years it has been around. But while the fact comes as no surprise, it brings about a sense of uneasiness - there’s something terribly discomforting about it. While these prizes aren’t the best representation of scientific contribution to the field, they do a decent job in reflecting the biases that exist in the field - like when Rosalind Franklin was essentially robbed of due credit for the Nobel prize that was awarded to Watson and Crick for their model of DNA despite her significant contributions to the study. Gender discrimination is ingrained in science, as is in the rest of our culture.\nAccording to the Global Gender Gap report, India is ranked 112th out of 149 countries. And the STEM field in the country remains no exception to these biases. In India, 40 percent of the STEM graduates are women but they comprise only 14 percent of the workforce. Women hold fewer senior positions of authority, are paid less than their male counterparts, and are severely underrepresented. And instances of discrimination, blatant or subtle, can be seen within the bounds of institutions; in the interactions in classrooms, the way certain faculty members are perceived, and how they are forced to have to assert their authority to be heard.\nWithin the STEM field as well, the gender ratios are severely skewed, owing to the supposed difference between what falls under ‘soft’ sciences and ‘hard’ sciences. For instance, biological or psychological sciences are deemed ‘soft’ sciences and tend to be female-dominated, while physics and engineering are considered ‘real’ or ‘hard’ sciences and are male-dominated. A possible explanation for this comes from the stereotype of women performing roles of caregiving or nurturing that are supposedly reflected in these so-called soft sciences and this work is considered easier than something more hands-on like those under the category of hard science.\nThe number of women at higher levels in the field progressively diminishes, particularly after the graduate levels - known as the ‘leaky pipeline’ effect, where the field is visualised as a series of pipes, with each higher level forming a new connecting pipe and women tend to ‘leak’ out of the pipe at higher stages. This happens because as women enter their mid-twenties, the pressure of getting married is inflicted upon them and they are forced to choose between taking care of and nurturing their family or working towards their career. The dearth of facilities and measures to provide women the means to pursue both simultaneously forces them to make this unreasonable choice.\nTrans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people have it much worse off in STEM, as they do in other walks of life since almost all dialogue on inclusivity in the field is limited to cisgender women. They face hostile work environments and are subject to harassment and exclusion. A study conducted by Science Mag in January 2021 shows that LGBTQ people in STEM are 30% more likely to face workplace harassment than their non-LGBTQ peers. One in two transgender physicists are harassed at university and research settings, according to a study by the American Physical Society. Anasuith P. Pridhvish, a trans woman who studies at a private university in Bangalore, tells Sayantan Datta in an article for the Life of Science, how the elevators are marked for ‘gents’ or ‘ladies’. She does not feel comfortable taking the elevator for males and does not have the option to use the one for females, which forces her to take eight flights of stairs every day. In India where recognition of these identities outside the binary of male and female seems like a far-fetched reality, the prevalence of gender-segregated spaces worsens their daily struggles and affects their mental health severely.\nThe UK has a framework that attempts to combat the issue. Called the Athena Scientific Women’s Academic Network (SWAN) charter, it was established in 2005 and functions in different institutions and pushes them to address these issues related to gender by following the charter’s ten principles. Institutions registered with the charter are expected to achieve the prescribed gender equality objectives and meet equality legislation requirements. The network promotes inclusive working practices in institutions, which increases the retention of valued academics and helps build the reputation of the institution. The charter has also expanded to provide support to trans staff and students and men, wherever appropriate. According to reports, this model has been successful in the UK and has been implemented in Australia as well, called Science Australia Gender Equity (SAGE).\nIndia’s Department of Science and Technology (DST), as well as the US and Canada, are in the process of implementing a scheme based on Athena under the name of GATI - Gender Advancement through Transforming Institutions. They plan to get institutes to conduct self-assessments on gender equity and carry out initiatives like gender sensitization programs. The DST will have to work through a lot of bureaucracy, especially in the top institutions like IITs and NITS that are government-run. Moreover, these policies are mainly directed at cis women and are vague about trans people.\nGender sensitization programs for all members of an institute, as mentioned in GATI’s plan of action, are a necessary step to create awareness of the discrimination that occurs and this paves the way to prevention of it by starting conversation about the topic. Affirmative action in the form of reservations, fee concessions and other measures for the upliftment of these marginalised and less privileged groups should also be ensured. Reservations are required for representation especially for positions of authority, which helps get rid of the negative stereotyping and makes room for more diverse role models in the field. It also becomes important to look at these measures through an intersectionality lens, keeping in mind the prevalence of caste and class barriers. Providing gender-neutral spaces, the usage of the right pronouns, and gender affirmative policies are small steps that go a long way in creating a comfortable atmosphere for trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming persons. Ensuring gender inclusivity is a daunting task, but not an impossible one."

    "title": "Wildlife in India",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Some of my work from the course ‘Wildlife in India’ in the sixth semester of my undergraduate degree at Azim Premji University\n\nThe people of India have had a deep-rooted, fluctuating relationship with nature. Based on the discussions in class and the various texts provided to us, it is evident that this relationship today has evolved from one of reverence to one that sees nature as merely a repository of resources owing to events in the past and discourse on conservation has been and is limited to a small set of people in positions of privilege.\nIndia’s relationship with nature stems from ancient history, seen from the Harappan civilisation. The hunter-gatherer tribes in the Indus valley civilisation had animals and plants involved in their lives, for which archaeological evidence exists in the form of seals that are found with animals like elephants, tigers, buffalos and rhinos and other art that depicts faunal diversity. Even in their spirituality – Harappan Gods were associated with plants and animals, adorned with horns and headgear made of plants, which symbolises the central role of nature in their lives. Different regions of the country also have several linguistic terms and superstitions regarding nature – like different names of the rain in Assam, myths of frogs being married, demons guarding the Kanchenjunga and other traditions. Forms of art and folklore also serve as sources of knowledge and should be acknowledged that way and not be taken for granted.\nThroughout history, the people of India had a dependence on forests in the past, in particular a relationship of reverence. But this began to change with monarchy and colonialism. Kings from as early as the fifteenth century conducted wildlife hunts. The British also had significant cultural differences with respect to interactions with the environment, primarily with an economic incentive and for sport.\nIn accordance with this incentive, they found that getting rid of animals made it easier to control forests and expand agriculture. And as agriculture, land use and the population expanded, levels of conflict between people and animals also increased which led to a shift in people’s views. Animals were seen as vermin, and this was constantly reinforced by calling animals ‘pests. This gave a moral justification their extermination and highlights the importance of the language they used to describe animals. For example, they called the tiger a ‘cunning, silent, savage enemy’. This impact of the usage of words and framing of nature constantly affected relationships with nature, even in the future and today. It gives the exploitation a different meaning as forests today are seen as ‘inert objects’ that are used as repositories of resources. This justification of looting nature stemmed from the past and has percolated to the present day.\nWildlife laws today have been heavily influenced by the colonisers. Gadgil and Guha describe in their book ‘Conquest and Control’ the link between imperialism and environmental degradation. World ecology has been profoundly altered by western capitalism, colonialism and global control of resources. The British used India’s forests extensively for coal, timber for industrial and political needs. Most significant was the use of teak for shipbuilding and the railways in the 1800s.\nThe British saw railways as a necessity, not for the movement of people (which was one reason the people saw it as a useful contribution to their lives) but for the faster movement of goods to ports. The extensive network of railways in the country led to severe deforestation. Trees were felled for creating the tracks, clearing area and for coal. The only kinds of timber that could be used were teak, Sal and Deodar and at the time of railway expansion, Indian forests looked inexhaustible. Eventually, in 1862, they realised that this wasn’t true and the forest department made forest conservancy of administrative importance to “ensure the sustained availability of forests to meet the enormous requirements of the railways”. The existing system in place was based on community norms so new rules were brought in that attempted to bring large parts of the forest under state control. The three contesting views were of annexing all forests and bring under state control, a more liberal view which was to respect the existing community norms – letting some parts remain common and a pragmatic view to bring forests under state control along with negotiating with the locals. It was in this context that the Indian Forest Act was brought about in 1865 to assert state monopoly through it. It facilitated the acquisition of those forest areas designated for railway use. It was ensured that existing rights did not overrule the state from accessing it. It was hastily done and had a lot of loopholes. This required a memorandum in 1875 which led to the Indian Forest Act of 1878. While the 1878 act still brought forests under state control, it sought that state intervention be minimal, respecting existing norms.\nWhile this was the time of the inception of a growing consciousness amongst political actors about the environment and its resources (which may or may not have been an implication of political agenda) that later extended to prominent figures like Indira Gandhi, Salim Ali, J C Kumarappa who were vocal about protecting the environment and brought about policy changes, there was still the debate of the dichotomy between development and sustainably and whether they could happen at the cost of the other. While these figures played important roles in conservation, them being the forerunners can be unsettling because they are not the people directly impacted by the effects of environmental degradation and possibly why they should not be taken at face value, as seen from the incident of the Bharatpur bird sanctuary. The marginalised communities that live in the forests and rely on them and vice versa should be the voices of conservation and not be sidelined as is the case today."

    "title": "On Prison Abolition",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is an essay I wrote for my undergraduate course on Public Reasoning in 2020.\n\nThe Prison Industrial Complex should be abolished.\nThe idea of locking people up as a form of punishment has existed since the time of monarchy. But so has the idea of corporal punishment and its other brutal forms- for instance, burning people alive for petty treason under the English common law. If the latter has been abolished, there is no reason why the former shouldn’t be. And the justification for abolition follows.\nThe problem with prisons is that it is morally wrong to lock people up and put them away from society, as their lives are not given any value as human beings anymore. It causes the breaking up of families, cultural degradation, and destruction of livelihoods and it further exacerbates societal harms instead of fixing them. Incarceration hasn’t been proven successful, as there has been no decrease in crime rates or an increase in public safety. The prison population in the world has seen about a 500% increase in the past four decades, but there has only been an increase in crime rates, going from a 13% increase in 1980 to a 45% increase in 2019. In America, there are four and a half times as many crimes in every million population today as there were twenty years ago. The recidivism rates have also been growing - with an average follow-up period of two years in a study conducted for 11 countries, reported re-arrest rates were between 26% and 60%, reconviction rates ranged from 20% to 63%, and reimprisonment rates varied from 14 to 45%. The other inherent problem with the idea of the prison system is the treatment of inmates in penitentiaries. They are not given any means to better their life outside of prisons. It does not give means to provide adequate housing, access to education or living wage jobs, or even proper mental health treatment. Many individuals released from prison have difficulty finding jobs to support themselves and reconnecting with family members. The activist and researcher James Kilgore, himself formerly incarcerated, has said, “The overwhelming problem for people inside prison is not that their labor is super exploited; it’s that they’re being warehoused with very little to do and not being given any kind of programs or resources that enable them to succeed once they do get out of prison.” Imprisonment destroys employment prospects and family ties, contributing to persistent poverty, inequality and intergenerational cycles of disadvantage. This also emphasises the need to remove the stigma associated with former convicts.\nIt also propagates forms of slavery and enhances the existing social hierarchies, resulting in ill-treatment of the already vulnerable groups, like women, transgenders, lower castes, etc. There is also a clear racial disproportion in the prison populations across the world. Angela Davis, a renowned abolitionist, has said in her book ‘Are Prisons Obsolete? (2003)’,“Are we willing to relegate ever larger numbers of people from racially oppressed communities to an isolated existence marked by authoritarian regimes, violence, disease, and technologies of seclusion that produce severe mental instability?” Moreover, a majority of people incarcerated are because of petty, non-harmful crimes that do not require confinement, like drug abuse, possession, vagrancy, etc. For instance, in Texas, 524,000 people were jailed in 2018 for unpaid traffic tickets. Other problems that have led to mass incarceration is the unnecessary criminalization of certain unavoidable factors, like poverty, vagrancy, drug abuse and addiction, which are either caused due to mental illnesses or are beyond the reach of those in the lower strata of society, for which they do not receive treatment for in prisons.\nPrisons in India are also notorious for their poor living conditions. With an average occupancy rate of 115% of their capacity, Indian jails continue to remain congested and overcrowded, numbers in the National Crime Records Bureau’s “Prison Statistics India – 2017” report has revealed.\nThe amount of money invested in prisons does not reap the benefits it claims to. In the US, more money is being spent on prisons than education. Around 15 states spend at least $27,000 more per prisoner than they do per student. This futile act of incarceration costs a lot of money, which can rather be invested in more fruitful activities like healthcare or education, which will help alleviate the problems in society.\nPeople commit crimes either due to the poor conditions they are forced to live in, mental health issues or out of ill will. And the reasons for their incarceration are firstly, to bring about reform and rehabilitation to those who have been convicted, and secondly, the retributive reasons for those who do it out of harmful tendencies. The first reason has been proven ineffective, as seen from the statistics of crime rates and recidivism. Addressing the reason for retribution, a paper by Andrew Oldenquist in the Journal of Philosophy (1988) gives insight into retribution, offering both sides of the argument. Though he claims that morally accepting retribution is vital to a viable moral community, it can empirically become revenge. And he also says that the fact that retribution has utility does not give us reason to accept it. “If we say retribution has utility, we could mean that we have a better society if people falsely believe members of their moral community sometimes deserve to be punished. This is the”noble lie” view. It is, I believe, elitist in the bad sense; the very idea of philosophy seems absurd if philosophers must conclude that the best world is one in which the majority of people must believe what is false.” Martha C Nussbaum, a professor of law and ethics at the University of Chicago says on the inefficacy of retribution, “It is very natural to resent when one is wronged, and the demand for payback or retribution, which is in my view the most problematic aspect of anger, probably has an evolutionary basis. Punishment of some type may be useful for the future, by deterring wrongdoing and reforming offenders. But the retributive idea of blood for blood is useless and hollow: killing doesn’t bring back the dead, it just creates a chain of resentment that is bad for individuals and bad for society.”\nIt is thus evident that the idea of prisons is hypocritical as it violates human rights in order to correct/punish those who violate human rights. This brings about the need for an alternative, which can be seen from examples of countries who have succeeded in their methods of ‘prison’. The most effective prisons are the ones that look least like prisons. For instance, Scandinavian countries like Norway have paved the way for such systems. Their focus is on rehabilitation and not retribution. There are no bars, barbed wires or cells. The underlying principle is restorative and transformative justice. Restorative justice involves those convicted engaging in dialogue with the individual and communities affected by their actions. They must then work with those parties to develop actions to try to repair the damage done as much as possible. The process is restorative because the goal is to restore the victim, their community, and the offender, to how they were before the transgression occurred. People who commit violence are hurt by the violence they commit and therefore need to be part of any process that seeks to find justice for that violence. Transformative justice is the concept of asking the offender what in their life has led them to commit the act, and what we all can do to change those conditions. Through either restorative or transformative justice, the systemic analysis takes the place of individual interrogation and punishment. It may be hard to imagine a victim of a violent transgression sitting down for a discussion with the perpetrator, but there have been many situations in which the victim or the victim’s family has actually been more fulfilled by a restorative process, or feel they have attained greater justice through restorative-justice models. An obvious benefit of the restorative model is that it takes into account not just the singular event, but the structural problems surrounding and leading up to the offence. These methods have been successful because they incorporate the fact that people change and as Aristotle said, can practice to become more virtuous. This is also reflected in the statistics of these nations. In Norway, only one in five (20%) of adults leaving prison are reconvicted within two years of release. Similar reoffending rates are seen across the Scandinavian nations. In Uruguay’s National Rehabilitation Centre, the recidivism rate is just 12%; in Germany, it’s 33% within three years. Norway’s incarceration rate is just 75 per 100,000 people, while in the US it is 707. The crime rates are also among the lowest.\nPeople deserve a second chance because many grow and change. They robbed to feed an addiction and then got sober. They assaulted someone because they were mentally ill and then got treatment and stabilized. They mature as they age beyond their teens and early 20s. That’s why we need to treat them as humans and abolish prisons."
