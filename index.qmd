# Aarathi Parameswaran (she/her)

Hi! I'm a master's student in physics at the University of Bonn, as a part of the Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy. I'm working on my master's thesis on optimal networks under [Prof. Dr. Dirk Witthaut](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/witthaut_d) as a part of the [Network Science Group](https://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/witthaut/index.html) at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Cologne and the [Energy Networks and Complex Systems Group](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ice/ice-1/research/research-groups/energy-networks-and-complex-systems) at the Institute of Climate and Energy Systems (ICE-1) at Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich. I received my bachelor's degree in physics with interdisciplinary studies in Media and Democracy from Azim Premji University, India. 

I am interested in the fundamentals of network science theory and its applications to the social sciences, specifically in areas such as polarization, inequalities, misinformation and opinions in social networks. I am looking for PhD positions starting fall 2025.
