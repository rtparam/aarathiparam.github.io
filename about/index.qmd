I am currently pursuing a master of science in physics at the University of Bonn as a part of the Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy. I am in my final semester of study, working on my master's thesis titled 'Structural Transitions in Optimal Networks' under [Prof. Dr. Dirk Witthaut](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/witthaut_d). I began my thesis in May 2024 and I expect to finish it by April 2025, after which the work will be published. 

I completed my bachelor of science (honours) in physics, with an interdisciplinary study in media and democracy at Azim Premji University, Bangalore from 2019-2022. My bachelor's thesis titled 'Investigating Taylor-Couette Flow' was a computational and experimental study on the fluid dynamics phenomenon of Taylor-Couette flow.

Apart from covering undergraduate level physics, I also took courses across disciplines; my interdisciplinary studies was on Media and Democracy. I also took courses on  political philosophy, wildlife studies and our core courses on understanding India which covered the history and evolution of demography of India through the lenses of caste, class, gender and religion. I truly cherished my time at the liberal studies program at APU because of the opportunity I had to study fields outside of my major, which have changed my perspective about the society we live in. 

My interdisciplinary studies form a big part of what I aspire to do in my research career, using the skills I have honed as a physicist and to do work that has a social impact. My ethos as an aspiring researcher in network science involves an anti-disciplinary approach that draws from post-positivist thought and Feyerabend's epistemological anarchy. This is informed by my interest in the philosophy of science and from my goal to do research for social good.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing football, running and spend a significant amount of my day reading or playing guitar. I am also a trained musician, as a vocalist and instrumentalist; I play five instruments and I grew up learning Indian and Western Classical music. And when I am back in my hometown of Kochi in India, you can find me by a beach or kayaking in a river with my little (dog) brother Velu :)
