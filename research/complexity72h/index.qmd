**Date**: June 2024

I participated in the [Complexity72h Workshop](https://complexity72h.com/) held at the Carlos III University of Madrid in June 2024. The week-long workshop consisted of lectures, talks, tutorials and a final project where participants in groups deliver a pre-print of the project completed within 72 hours. 

Our team was supervised by Dr. Ebrahim Patel from the University of Greenwich, for the project titled 'Assessing Metro Networks Efficiency Using Max-Plus Algebra'. The project involved the optimization of transportation networks, specifically the metro networks of Amsterdam and Milan, using Max-Plus Algebra. 

Find the pre-print below:
