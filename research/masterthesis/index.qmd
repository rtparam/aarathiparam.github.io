Ongoing master thesis with [Prof. Dr. Dirk Witthaut](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/witthaut_d) and [Dr. Iva Bačić](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zkK3JdcAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Network Science Group at the University of Cologne and the Energy Networks and Complex Systems Group at Forschungszentrum Jülich, and co-advised by [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Klaus Lehnertz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dv8glggAAAAJ&hl=en). I am studying structural transitions, specifically the phenomena of symmetry breaking in the topology of optimal networks, extended to multi-layer networks.
I am expected to finish my thesis by April 2025, after which a paper will be produced for publication.
