My bachelor thesis, under the supervision of [Dr. Kaustubh Manchanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaustubh-manchanda-18467890/?originalSubdomain=in) at Azim Premji University, Bangalore, was on a nonlinear dynamical fluid mechanics phenomenon known as Taylor-Couette flow. The project consisted of a computational and experimental study of fluid dynamics, using methods from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and an experimental setup of the Taylor-Couette reactor.
