# My Cooking Network

I love cooking, for myself, for the people I love. I also love exploring and experimenting with cuisines. So I decided to document this favourite activity of mine using a favourite academic activity of mine: Networks! Here are the dishes I've made recently, in the form of a bipartite network with dishes and ingredients labelled according to the different cuisines they fall under. I made this using <code>NetworkX</code> and <code>PyVis</code>. This is a work in progress, and I constantly update it when I get the time (or make something exciting). Click on a node to explore details.
