title: My Reading List
---

I've been an avid reader since childhood, a habit that was instigated by watching my older sister and one that piqued during my advent as a quizzer on the school team. Through high school, as was the case with most other people my age, this habit died and took a long time to be resurrected during my undergraduate studies.

To motivate myself to hold on to this past time that I love, I started documenting the text I've read since 2024. Tracking progress, some thoughts, and brief reviews on the books I've been reading can be found on my Notion Website: [Aarathi's Bookshelf](https://burnt-jump-779.notion.site/104dac9bc253807e8266d3c9026489fb?v=fffdac9bc25381d9b267000c731cc391)
