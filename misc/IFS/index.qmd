I was invited to be one of the speakers for the segment titled 'Portrait of a Young Scientist in India: Aspirations and Challenges of doing Impactful Research in India' at the opening of the Infosys Science Foundation in Bangalore, India on the 14th of July 2022. I got to express my views about the prospects of doing research in India, need for better funding in research, gender equity in STEM, effective science communication and the gender and caste biases that are propagated in the system and I had the opportunity to meet eminent scientists and businesspeople attending the event.
