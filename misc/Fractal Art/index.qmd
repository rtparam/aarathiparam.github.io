title: Fractal Art
---
After being introduced to the topologically intricate world(s) of fractals from my undergraduate nonlinear dynamics course, I had taken to dabble with them on Python. Of late, this hobby was re-ignited after some hooking, intense music sessions listening to the Japanese neo-psychedelic rock band [*Kikagaku Moyo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egmECvOCZ8Y). The name of the band translates to 'geometric patterns' and images of fractals were the first to pop into my head. 

Here is some fractal art I've generated recently. A work in progress, I am trying to use <code>MoviePy</code> to extract audio features from the music for the animation.
