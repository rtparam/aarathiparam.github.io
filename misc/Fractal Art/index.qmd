title: Fractal Art
---

My journey into the topologically intricate realms of fractals began during my undergraduate nonlinear dynamics course. Recently, this fascination has been reignited by discovering the Japanese neo-psychedelic rock band [*Kikagaku Moyo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egmECvOCZ8Y). The bandâ€™s name translates to "geometric patterns," evoking vivid images of fractals that have captivated my imagination.

Below, I present a selection of fractal art I have generated in recent weeks. This project is still a work in progress, as I explore the integration of audio features extracted from their mesmerizing music using <code>MoviePy</code> to enhance the animation.
